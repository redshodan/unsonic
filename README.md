About
=====
Unsonic is a free drop in replacement for the Subsonic music server. It follows
the Subsonic API and is usable with existing Subsonic clients without requiring
any adjustment to them.

Unsonic strives to be better at handling music files tags, playing of those
songs and use less system resources.


Supported Clients
=================
These are the clients that are known to work well:
  * DSub (Android)
  * JamStash (web)

These clients sort of work with isues:
  * Clementine (Linux desktop)


Installation
============
Unsonic requires Python 3.6 or greater to work.

## Install Unsonic as a system service via pip
  * pip3 install unsonic
  * sudo unsonic install
  * <Edit /etc/unsonic.ini and update database and music libraries>
  * su unsonic -c 'unsonic sync'
  * su unsonic -c 'unsonic adduser <username> <password>'
  * systemctl start unsonic


## Running Unsonic from source
  * make build
  * make run


Installing a Web Client
-----------------------
  * Download/clone Jamstash from https://github.com/tsquillario/Jamstash
  * Edit your config.ini so that the unsonic.ui path points to jamstash/dist
  
  ```
  [unsonic]
  ui = ../Jamstash/dist
  ```
  
  * With Unsonic running, point your browser at the url printed out, normally
    something like http://localhost:6543 and your will be redirected to the load
    Jamstash.
  * Jamstash is very picky about the server URL in it's configuration. Make sure
    there is no trailing '/' character otherwise Jamstash will not be able to
    build the path correctly.


Docker Installation
-------------------
Docker files are located in the ./docker directory. The Makefile contains some 
convenience targets but the specific ``docker`` and/or ``docker-compose`` cmmands
are also shown.

To build the Unsonic Docker image:

```
$ docker build ./docker
```

Or using docker-compose:

```
$ docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml build
```

The docker-compose file defines 3 containers, each is geared toward a development/test setup; a
production Docker should only use these as a reference. The containers defined are of PostgreSQL,
and an Unsonic serve based on PostgreSQL and SQLite. The Unsonic containers requires a music
directory to volume mount so one must be specified.

```
$ MUSIC_DIR=~/music/ docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml create
$ MUSIC_DIR=~/music/ docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up Unsonic-postgres
```


Or using the Makefile to simplify all of the above.

```
$ make MUSIC_DIR=~/music/ docker-sqlite
```

See docker/Dockerfile for details about the ``unsonic`` image. The container details are 
defined ``docker/docker-compose.yml``. The files ``docker/config.ini`` and ``docker/unsonic-init``
can be used to tweak the Unsonic process itself.


Adjusting the configuration
---------------------------
The main configuration settings are the location of the database

```
[mishmash]
sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///%(here)s/build/development.sqlite
```

and the location of the music libraries

```
[library:Music]
paths = ~/music
sync = true

[library:More Music]
paths = /data/music
sync = true

```

Adjust them to fit your deployment needs. The mishmash.paths can have multiple 
music directories, one per line. %(here)s refers to the location of the 
configuration file itself.


Setting up LastFM
-----------------
Unsonic includes support for querying LastFM for artist/album information out of
the box. In addition, you can configure Unsonic with your LastFM account to enable
scrobbling.

```
$ unsonic config -s "lastfm.user=lastfm-user" unsonic-user
$ unsonic config -s "lastfm.password=lastfm-password" unsonic-user
```

Running with TLS
----------------
Unsonic itself doesn't handle TLS, but can easily be run behind a reverse proxy
that does. The following example shows how to configure nginx to reverse proxy
to a local Unsonic instance. Replace example.com with your domain name/IP. You
may change the path portion of the url from "unsonic" to whatever you wish, or
remove it completely.

This would go into your /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or its own file in
/etc/nginx/sites-available depending on how your distro is setup.

```
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    server_name  example.com;

    ssl config...

    # Your Unsonic is located on https://example.com/
    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_buffers 16 4k;
        proxy_buffer_size 2k;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:6543;
        proxy_read_timeout 90;
    }
```

Developing Unsonic
==================
Running tests requires docker.

### Development build
  * make devel
  * make devel-run


### Tests
  * make tests


Running
-------
  * ./bin/unsonic -c <config.ini> sync
  * ./bin/unsonic -c <config.ini> adduser name pass
  * ./bin/unsonic -c <config.ini> serve [--reload]


Manual Testing
--------------
  * ./test/bin/tester getArtists


New DB Version
--------------
  * ... Edit schema classes
  * make devel-clean
  * make devel-db
  * ./venv/bin/alembic -c unsonic/alembic/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m
    "comment"
  * ... DB schema should still be the older version
  * bin/unsonic -c unsonic/etc/development.ini listusers
  * ... Check DB schema matches new revision
  * ... Check in new revision file
