API
===
Exceptions
----------
* No LDAP auth
* No simple hex encoded passwords
* 'search' is deprecated, not going to implement
* addChatMessage/getChatMessage not stubbed out cause its silly and a very poor API
* changePassword:
  * You can change your own password without being an admin, as long as you're not
    a guest.
  * username param is not required, will default to your own username if not supplied.
* savePlayQueue: id is not required, means delete the playqueue and don't create
  one in its place

General
-------
* pathing for responses is weird, has a dash. missing .mp3 ending.
* Fit guest account concept into the subsonic API. Make it play well with
  sharing urls
* Figure out the differences between path/id3 results. Maybe union them? Prolly
  just return thing for the right kind of call
* Older calls were never updated for newer param frameworks.
