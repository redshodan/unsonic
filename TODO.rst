* Minimize ini config. Store as much as possible in the db through the config
  command. Allow for ini file to override built in defaults for everything. Have
  an installed default ini file to read in, then user's if found else
  /etc/unsonic. All commands look for the same ini's to find the db url to
  startup, or cmdline arg for db url.

  call.

  class.param_defs array.


API
===
Exceptions
----------
* No LDAP auth
* No simple hex encoded passwords
* 'search' is deprecated, not going to implement
* addChatMessage/getChatMessage not stubbed out cause its silly and a very poor API
* changePassword:
  * You can change your own password without being an admin, as long as you're not
    a guest.
  * username param is not required, will default to your own username if not supplied.
* savePlayQueue: id is not required, means delete the playqueue and don't create
  one in its place


General
-------
* Fit guest account concept into the subsonic API. Make it play well with
  sharing urls
* Older calls were never updated for newer param frameworks.
